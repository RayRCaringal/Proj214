testcaseE:

-This test case could be considered an extension of testcase A and B, but instead of doing it a specified amount of time we do it as many time as we're able too
 as in the size of the memory. This also tests the edgecase of mallocing the final byte

 testcasF:

 -This test case randomly fills the memory with bytes betweens sizes 1 to size of the memory until is either full or the malloc has been called 100 times. This tests what
 happens when you request several memory sizes too large to store. As you could get 4095 bytes and then 4096 bytes, but of course you only have 1 byte remaining. We included 
 this because it seemed like a good way to test the error checking functions.
